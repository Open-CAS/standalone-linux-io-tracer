*** Running tests ***

    Test controller requirements:
        - python >= 3.6
        - python requirements from the file "modules/test-framework/requirements.txt"

    Device Under Test requirements:
        - packages specified in file "tests/dut_requirements.txt"

    To install the latter type:
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    To start tests call the following command from 'tests' directory:
        python3 -m pytest --dut-config="path/to/config" --log-path="path/to/logs"

    The command executes pytest module. All tests in the working directory are then
    discovered and executed on the DUT specified in the dut config.


*** The DUT config file ***

    DUT config file is a yaml file which configures where the tests are run.

    'ip' field should be filled with valid IP string to use remote ssh executor
    or it should be commented out when user want to execute tests on local machine

    An example of DUT config can be found in "tests/config/example_config.yml"

    WARNING!
    If no disks are specified in DUT config, the framework formats all non-system drives!
